ip.addr == 10.0.0.1: Show all traffic with 10.0.0.1 as either source or destination
ip.addr == 10.0.0.0/24: Show all traffic to and from any addresses in 10.0.0.0/24
ip.src == 10.0.0.1 && ip.dst == 10.0.0.2: Show all traffic from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2
!(ip.addr == 10.0.0.1): Exclude all traffic to or from 10.0.0.1
!(arp or icmp or stp): Filter out background traffic from ARP, ICMP and STP
icmp.type == 3: Show ICMP "destination unreachable" packets
tcp or udp: Show TCP or UDP traffic
tcp.port == 80: Show TCP traffic with port 80
tcp.srcport < 1000: Show TCP traffic with source port range
https or dns: Show all HTTPS or DNS traffic
tcp.flags.syn == 1: Show TCP packets with SYN flag set
tcp.flags == 0x012: Show TCP packets with both SYN and ACK flags set
tcp.analysis.retransmission: Show all retransmitted TCP packets
http.request.method == "GET": Show TCP packets associated with HTTP GET
http.response.code == 404: Show packets associated with HTTP 404 response
http.host == "www.github.com" == Show HTTP traffic matching the Host header field
tls.handshake: Show only TLS handshake packets
tls.handshake.type == 1: Show client Hello packet during TLS handshake
frame contains example: Show all packets that contain the word "example"
frame.len > 1000: Show all packets with total length larger than 1000 bytes
eth.addr == 00:11:22:33:44:55: Show DHCP packets for client MAC address
eth[0x47:2] == 01:80: Match Ethernet frames with 2 bytes at an offset of 0x47 == 01:80
